## Technologies
For this application the technologies that were used were but not limited too: Javascript, Jquery, Handlebars, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Active Record, HTMl, Sass, JSON, Bootsrap, Animate.css, Purecss, and curl

## Approach
My approach on the backend with this one was to actually simplify what I had previously done on project two. I think I had over complicated my ERD then and I wanted to stick to what was needed this time around. I have a one-to-many relationship.

I enjoy writing logic on the backend although I did less customizing
on the backend this time around I still enjoyed using rails.
Because of poor planning i actually had to reconsider what I was doing but jumping on this first helped relieve any of that.

## Major Hurdles

I actually wish I planned the backend better this time around. I had a hard time trying to come up with the right structure that worked for the app. I had to tweak things here and there early on and thrashed a little bit all becuase I diddnt take the time to stop and think but I was able to get through it.
